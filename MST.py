# Primâ€™s MST algorithm applies a greedy approach via use of a priority queue data structure to determine what elements (nodes) are connected to other elements (nodes). Given a source Node of A with edges 1, 3, this method will add both edge values to a priority queue, before selecting the smaller of the two edges (1) to use as a means of navigation to the node asscoiated with said smaller edge. The process repeats until an MST is formed. Additional information is provided below.
